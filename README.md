# Mingw64 [D]river [D]evelopment [K]it - Template

A demonstration on how to compile Windows kernel drivers using Mingw64.

## How?

You will need an modern Mingw64-GCC toolchain.
Do not use any broken toolchains like the one shipped with debian-10.
Instead either use Zeranoe's build script with `make deps` or use your own.

## What?

1. ddk-template: plain and stupid ddk example
2. ddk-template-cplusplus: same, but in C++, including a very complex class

## Build and Test

Build all examples with a Mingw64 toolchain using Zeranoe's build script:

``
make all
``

Build all examples with your own Mingw64 toolchain:

``
make all CC=path/to/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc DDK_INCLUDE_DIR=path/to/include/ddk
``

Build Mingw64 only:

``
make deps
``
